Question,"I read:


Google CEO says a quarter of the company’s new code is already AI generated.
According to Stack Overflow’s 2024 Developer Survey, over 75 percent of respondents are already using or are “planning to use” AI tools to assist with software development.
Another survey by GitHub indicated that 92 percent of US-based developers are currently using AI coding tools.


Based on this overwhelming use of genAI for coding, could the 2-year-old ban on using genAI for coding in SO answers be lifted? The ban was established when LLMs were much weaker (e.g., ~230 fewer elos on this benchmark) and when humans were less acquainted with LLMs.

Comment on Question,"if this policy changes, a lot of real humans will leave, because this site would become nothing more than a frontend to ChatGPT, and the ""people"" posting answers will be sockpuppets of ChatGPT. there is no joy in any of that.

Comment on Question,"that opens the door for crafty people that will, or already do, use AI to generate a bunch of question-answer pairs for which the LLM came up with the answer and the human merely made the machine rephrase the text so it doesn't reek of ChatGPT's style. that's equivalent to someone googling on a topic they have no clue of, then writing an answer. that is terrible. ""legalization"" is strategically a bad move. I'd rather they keep the policy, and anyone who feels like having an LLM assist them had better make damn sure it's not a substitute for their own competence.",Christoph Rackwitz,14929,0,0

Answer,"NO

Even assuming that Google's CEO has an accurate picture of who and how writes their gargantuan code base, what they do is not our concern.

Using AI to assist with software development is not the same as presenting solutions to other people's questions as if you were a subject-matter expert.


The main issues with AI posts (answers in particular) which prompted the ban all remain:

No matter how good a GenAI model is, they can still hallucinate. There's even research that suggests AI models may never not hallucinate. The burden of vetting such content that looks good on the surface but may be fundamentally flawed then falls on the shoulders of an already strained community.
GenAI content can be produced at a much faster rate than what the community is able to curate/moderate
Even for vetted content, moderators (but anyone except the poster really) are unable to verify claims that the content was actually vetted beforehand. It'd come down to hunches and subjective bias. That kind of moderation is prone to be unfair and ineffective.
plagiarism: after having handled thousands of AI flags on this site, I can tell you that almost nobody gives proper credit to the AI. Folks tend to present the content as their own, thus misrepresenting someone else's work.
The only value proposition that Stack Overflow still has over an LLM is that there's the expectation that a human being has authored the text as written.
Allowing for an exception this big to the AI ban would open the floodgates.

There is a case to be made about using AI to improve a post's grammar, formatting, etc. but that suffers from the same issues as point #3.
I really don't see how we could realistically allow AI content in almost any form while staying true to Stack Overflow's values and a Community made of humans at its core.

Comment on Answer,I’ve never heard (until now) anyone saying that they would contribute more/better to Stack Overflow if they only had to spend less effort. That seems like the opposite of what we want to encourage.,Clive,36936,14,0

Comment on Answer,"But why bother putting in extra systems for something which delivers no value? “I can expend less effort” doesn’t seem reasonable - if you don’t have the time/will, then don’t do it, leave it for those that do.

Comment on Answer,"@FranckDernoncourt When humans hallucinate, it's usually more obviously wrong, and even when it isn't they can't output realistic-looking nonsense at nearly the same rate that AI can so either way it's much less of a curation/moderation burden (I notice you didn't address any of blackgreen's points about that).",John Montgomery,7087,3,0
