How are you going to host and distribute your app? How are you going to ensure you're complying with all state and local regulations about privacy, and pass any audits? How are you going to deal with legal issues when people sue you because someone got stalked through your app? How are you going to keep your server backend secure? How are you going to keep the whole software stack up to date and patched for the latest security vulnerabilities? How are you going to ensure your app isn't infringing on copyrights and trademarks? A new regulation passed after you launched your app, how do you find out if you're subject to new regulations and how do you update your business to comply?

An AI can help you answer these questions, but your questions are going to depend on your circumstances, and the AI won't necessarily be able to tell you the *right* questions to ask.

AI is definitely going to remove a lot of barriers to entry though, so a lot of people are going to be able to execute on their ideas in a way that they weren't able to before. This is going to lead people to invest in a plethora of new businesses, and those business are all going to need vendors, which will spawn even more businesses to serve them, and on and on.",2

52,36,1,tuba_man,21191,172192,None,0,"Yes, AI will obviously inevitably get 'better'. The interesting question is ""how do the limits of our understanding limit the *ways* AI can improve?""

GPT3 is a 175-billion-bumper pachinko machine. AI is only improving as quickly as it is because it turns out most human activity (communication especially) is predictable. So it's easy enough to pantomime expertise with a large enough predictive model.

The thing is, that pantomime is the only thing *every* AI is doing. Yes, AI will inevitably improve at any task where the goal is to follow along with an operator or respond predictably to complex input. As useful as Automated Inferencing is, how do you get it to check its own work when it doesn't actually understand the content it's producing?

Let's go with the subject at hand, Stack Overflow. We can't even tell an AI ""check your work"" yet - what would that look like based on inferencing only?

1. Use \`question\` as GPT3 input, get \`answer\` output.
2. Run another model against \`question\` to infer the asker's intended inputs and acceptance criteria 
3. Use \`answer\` input into a model like github copilot to produce \`code\` output
4. Attempt to build & run code, repeat 2 until this succeeds
5. Run code against asker's intended input and compare output against inferred acceptance criteria.
6. If quality is acceptable, post, otherwise return to step 3

I suspect with enough effort and unlimited running costs, \*several\* AIs could be frankensteined together to make this kind of thing work, \*most of the time\*. Hell, they might even be able to automatically respond to duplicate questions with something other than ""already answered, use search you noob"", so that'd be an improvement lol

But that's not \*an\* AI, that's ~~a human~~ an AI Centepede.

\---

idk, sorry to dump a shitload of words on you. ""AI will improve"" bugs me because it's super vague. It leaves too much room to ignore the fact that all we're doing is asking a black box ""You've seen every line of code ever written, what do you think about this prompt?"" and seeing what comes out of it. (I know that's not fair, we also bolt black boxes together in creative ways to make AI do ever more interesting ""take a stab at it"" things

it turns out there's a \*shitload\* of really cool things that can be done once we taught computers how to make best guesses based on available data, but that's all we've done. We haven't hit the limits of this concept \*yet\*. It'd be a mistake to assume there aren't any limits though.",1
