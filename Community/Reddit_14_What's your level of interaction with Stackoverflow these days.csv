SO's shtick has been its commitment to only having one copy of a question open and answerable, with all others that can even be conceivably related to a previously asked question being closed and marked as duplicate. This worked back in the day when we lived in a development world where stacks were pretty cookie-cutter and everything didn't have it's own API to integrate with everything else. A modern tech stack is much more intermingled though, and because of this you often have newer questions that are completely unrelated stacks or completely different major versions of software being ""Closed as Duplicate"" when in reality they are two completely different scenarios/questions.

Your options are either to look through 15 years of unordered comments that resemble ""In version 8.3.1, on this platform, this doesn't work and you need to do blah blah blah"" or just search somewhere else - often times, my searches and their answers take me somewhere else - generally to some random blog article that gets me halfway there - or simply back to the official documentation.",211

It’s constantly prompting me with suggestions, the majority of which are either correct or at least relevant but may need tweaking.

Oh, wow. Where do I even begin with this disaster? This code is like a middle-school group project where no one communicated, yet somehow everyone decided to turn in their homework anyway. First off, import order. Is it random, or did you just throw darts at a list of imports? You're importing half of the world here, but it seems like you've never even heard of isort or flake8. And what’s with all the redundant imports? Are we really using randbytes here? Oh wait, we’re not. Just a random import for your collection, I suppose?

Let’s talk about logging. You’re logging every single step like you're narrating a documentary about how basic functions work. Nobody cares that you ""started hashing a password."" What are you doing, applying for a security clearance? Here’s a hint: a clean log should provide value, not read like a day-by-day diary of a bored developer.

The password change validation? Chef’s kiss. What if the passwordConfirm mismatches? You just serve up the same pointless log statement that we all saw coming. It’s like you've never heard of a proper response structure. ""Oh no, passwords don’t match!"" Welcome to the world of lazy validation.

Speaking of lazy, could you please, please stop with this Frankenstein’s monster of mixed responsibilities in your endpoints? You’re registering a user, hashing passwords, checking verification, setting cookies, and logging in—all in one blob of code. Who needs clean, modular services when you can throw everything into a 200-line method, right?

Also, SQLAlchemy queries littered with .filter() and .first() like you just discovered database queries yesterday. No, you don’t need a separate .filter() for every check, but clearly, optimization is a foreign concept to you.

And here comes my favorite part: email verification with hashing! A grand attempt at security—by someone who once read the title of an article on cryptography. Your implementation is about as trustworthy as a kid pretending to be a security guard. Are you even sure this code works in production? Actually, forget that question. We both know the answer.

I agree that ChatGPT was a death knell, but there were significant issues before:

* The company doesn't respect power users / volunteer mods
* The overwhelming majority of new questions are of low quality asked by very junior devs, biasing how mods and power users interact with questions
* The goal of a single canonical question and answer for every issue (closing everything else as a duplicate with a link to the original question) has failed to handle framework and language upgrades.",12
