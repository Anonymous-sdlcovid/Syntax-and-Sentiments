6,5,3,No-Champion-2194,1,7880,None,0,"Agreed.  I finally deleted my account.  My experience was looking for an answer regarding date handling in SQL Server.  I found a relevant post and an answer that worked fine, part of it was using DATEPART(hh...).  A moderator comes in to the thread and changes it to DATEPART(HOUR...).  The poster comes back and complains that his original answer was correct and documented as proper syntax and shouldn't have been edited.  The mod comes then berates the poster for not knowing the 'best' way to write the query.

On the site, I saw a question from an obviously junior developer who was struggling to write a query, but was clearly trying to learn.  I pointed out an obvious typo in his query, and explained what he should do without burying him in jargon.  I then get berated for responding to a question that wasn't properly stated, and told that I shouldn't guess that he made a typo.  Refusing to help a struggling dev because he didn't get his question right really shows the worst tendencies of the developer community.  I need to keep this in mind and be sure to be more patient with devs asking me for help.
