8372853,cigien,58811,"@Samathingamajig There's no need to ban it on Meta. The problems outlined in this question don't really apply to Meta, e.g. programming answers are not on-topic here, so SMEs aren't required to evaluate the answers. More importantly, the scale is completely different. Meta can't possibly get thousands of AI generated answers a day; it'll get noticed immediately if even 5-6 such answers get posted, and the community/moderators can deal with that quantity quite easily.",0

At ""best"" this means the user might get some downvotes while gaining some upvotes too, due to it looking like a good answer.

Having its answer overflow (pun intended) here reduces the diversity of answers which would not be a good thing. I've been using chatGPT (paid) for a couple months now to help me develop a product. It's invaluable! But it's often incorrect, confidently telling me the wrong things over and over. Even in those cases, however, it often leads me in the right direction (including better Google queries) and eventually to a working solution. (see full text)",0
455026,Alexis Pautrot,1132,"I agree too. I think novice developers should ask ChatGPT for newbies questions (no discrimination intended, anyone is a newbie on a domain he don't know yet) and only use Stack Overflow for more advanced questions. And the same apply to the answers. Novice developers should not try to answer a question for which they don't have an expertise. Being generated by an AI or by a newbie human, if the answer is blatantly wrong, measures has to be taken.",0

20399158,axelrothing,29,maybe stackoverflow will integrate an AI detector so that a user gets an automatic punishment if they are believed by the detector to have used technology's like ChatGPT,0
