What did we have back then? Library encyclopedias. Expensive to own, but relatively easy to access. Then we went to this wild distributed model, where information was coming from so many places that you couldn't do any kind of purchase or subscription model anymore. You can't expect people to subscribe to the individual google results they're getting back, right? So it went to advertising. I think we're going to see a reversal of that, back to silos (as you pointed out, we're already seeing it with Discord/etc). Except now, your Encyclopedia has 1000x as much information in it and it talks to you and teaches you things.

I am certain that libraries will soon have AI subscriptions, which I hope people who are too poor for an ad-free tier would take advantage of. I know there are people out there for whom that $7 extra per month for Hulu plus actually hurts, which is a budget so tight it shouldn't exist, but that's a different conversation.",1

104,103,10,itsdr00,20855,109491,None,0,"Google can't charge a subscription because it makes money by delivering ads on webpages, not its search site. Outside of sponsored links, you see almost zero advertisements on Google itself. They tried doing a subscription for the distributed ad model, but [it didn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Contributor), I would guess because it didn't have wide enough participation and couldn't compete with ad blocker, anyway. All that is to say, a subscription to Google would have no additional value, because the ads aren't on Google. It would just feel like price gouging at this point.

The comparison really starts to break down when you look at cost-per-user. Searches are dirt cheap. AI is crushingly expensive. You just can't make that much ad revenue per user. If GPT4-quality AI is available at search-engine prices, we might see ad-supported AI, but even then they'd still take a subscription payment. Why? Because it'd make way more money per-user, and unlike a search engine, it would actually add value. That's why Hulu does it: People will pay for it.

>(where even if one product is better, the other options are good enough that many people won't want to pay for the better one).

As someone who uses AI professionally, I can assure you, people will always want to pay for the best one. Not everyone needs it, but it has more than enough value for people in certain professions.",1

One of the obstacles when building a good model is not overtraining it to the point it's just 'remembering' the data it's been trained on.

But the issue the previous comment made proves that it could be beneficial to do this if you are able to claim credit for what a model produces.

Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that the only place with a standard high enough to train an effective LLM on, would be hated on by the users of the LLM.

If you sort by new and unanswered questions on SO, you will see just exactly why there are strict rules on asking questions.

SO is not for your minor uncertainty or first attempt at solving a problem. The amount of questions ""answered"" by an OP themselves moments later with some ""Nevermind, I forgot to add a closing bracket"" is staggering.

What people here are interpreting as arrogance and malicious intent is experienced users taking their time to answer people's questions freely.

You SHOULD be hesitant to ask a question on SO.

That means you will first try all you can to search for an actual answer, to actually frame your questioning. I cannot count how many times I have found something to try out that have solved my issues just my thoroughly structuring my question.

For newbie questions or quick feedback, use ""learn programming"" or ""programmingquestions"" on reddit, IRC or discord. THAT is the purpose of those tools.

The purpose of SO is in no way, shape or form that.

It is for high quality answered, to high quality questions.

""why does my conda environment fail on my home computer, but works on my job"" type questions is not high quality. Especially when 50 other users have asked pretty much the same question in the last week, only with some specifics to their own setup. 

It is a local and isolated question that can only be answered in a local and isolated context.

If you framed the same question, with with cross referenced chiseled out error messages, included possible similar issues from doing some research, with a focused description of what it is you fail to understand, THEN users would be able to actually help you.

SO is NOT the place to go to for casual help on something we are to lazy to look into or solve ourselves. And that is the power of SO. 

Asking low quality unstructured questions have to be discredited in order to keep both questions and answers in a high enough quality for an LLM to be able to use it. 

With out the gatekeeping of low quality questions, the quality of answers will dry up. 

Without the quality answers to quality questions on SO, the quality of LLM's will dry up, as an LLM is not able to actually answer anything, but only reference the most useful previously answered question in the context.",4
