People starting out are not really encouraged to ask, ""stupid questions"". The problem is you don't know what you don't know. So if asking questions to learn is discouraged, why would you continue to seek knowledge by asking people? The only stupid question is the one left unasked IMO.

You will get people arguing over the wording of your answers. People will then come and change the wording, which changes the meaning. Because they think they know what you meant. I've not personally had this issue, but I've seen it enough to know it's a bad problem.

It brings probably the most arrogant engineers I've ever met. People you simply cannot have a conversation with. My Senior and Principal engineering staff are all approachable people with a desire to share knowledge.

It was a bit of a running joke all the way thru that any question with real content would be locked / deleted quickly (and for seemingly irrelevant reasons) while totally silly and irrelevant arguments pages last for years.

Really glad that it's clearly dead these days and that AI has undercut any need for it, it was a horrid experiment gone wrong showing what happens when egos and disgusting self victimizers are allowed to dominate over merit.

Use AI models, Never look back, No one else ever make a site like the steaming pile of garbage that is S.O.

121,,0,Unairworthy,2091,16900,None,0,No. AI scraped and plagiarized it (fair game imho since it's user content anyway) so now people get the same info from AI. It doesn't work but the answer is instant and you don't get scolded for duplicate or open ended questions. And you aren't expected to pick a winner when you know jack shit and that's why you're asking.,0
