Doesn't always work, but it works far far more often than you'd think. You can even feed compiler errors etc into it and it does a decent at puzzling out and fixing them.

EDIT: For anything super complex though, you'd still have the be a competent programmer to either fix it yourself or know how to articulate what's wrong and tell the AI what it might be able to do to fix it. Sometimes that's a bit of prompt engineering but it might save you some time. I particularly like how it comes up with plausible ways to string libraries together into a minimal example and you can interrogate it about how to do other things with that setup or what it might look like if you swap out components with something else, or how you might wrap it into docker etc. If you really don't know where to start on putting together a project and only know the general parts you want to use and what your end goal is, it's pretty great.

If I made a new class called AdvancedFeature, inheriting from both AttackableFeature and PushableFeature, will that inherit memebers from BasicFeature once, or twice?


ChatGPT:

So in your example, if you have a class called AdvancedFeature that inherits from both AttackableFeature and PushableFeature, which both inherit from BasicFeature, then AdvancedFeature will only inherit the zone variable from BasicFeature once.

> This rule applies to all derived classes in C++, regardless of whether or not the parent class is a virtual base class. In C++, a class can only inherit from a given parent class once, regardless of whether that parent class is a virtual base class or not.

Since I was referring to fantasy cultures as ""Anglo-ish"" and ""Iberian-ish"", it picked up on my intent, and described cultures it suggested as ""Japanese-ish"" and ""Greek-ish"".

It understood each thing was that I mentioned in my description of the inn well enough to describe them individually and as a group of things.

I amended that third character to be a mute. It understood the concept of ""mute"", and it's suggestions for names of that character was influenced strongly by that concept.

It understood the positions of objects as I described them, as you can see in the summary.

It can go further. I have gone further in other logs. I had a session where I gave it a list of characters, and then asked it to suggest a plot outline for a short story featuring those characters.

After it spit out the plot, I amended the plot to ask it to kill off one of the characters at a certain point in time. It did so, and amended the rest of the plot to account for the fact that character was no longer present.

Lots of it's answers are surface level. It does a lot of rewording of what you have said to it. When you get into deep things it gets things wrong. Sometimes it's just wrong (like making up APIs that don't exist), and sometimes it's saying contradictions within sentences. For coding tasks I think you'll just get lots of broken submissions. Which isn't the end of the world if it's not caught since they will get a bad mark. For papers you're just going to get papers that are too light, and have too much surface level details within it.

Essentially to get really good stuff out of ChatGPT. You need to know your topic very well, and know how to fix / parse the outputs coming back out. But in that case it's not really plagiarism, but a research tool used by students who know the material. Even if they copy and paste sections of work.

Yes, maybe not exactly that question and answer, so the outputs are unique, but certainly very similar problems.

457,456,11,Inevitable_Vast6828,1,227,None,0,"Well... I think the debatable part is mostly on the human end of things.  We basically do know how the model operates so we can safely say that it does things by correlation rather than reason or understanding.  So I think the question is whether or not human creativity is just an illusion as well.  That is, what we assert about the model is not a philosophical debate, what goes on with humans is.  

Ranting you can skip: 

I was just commenting to someone else about Flamingo, which tries to do so called ""one shot learning"" on top of other large pretrained models (80 billion parameters).  

A sort of popular myth has spread in the AI community that humans learn from very few examples.  I don't believe this is true for basic knowledge, they seem to either learn only after a huge number of examples, or they learn things that are pre-baked into development, aka instinct.  Sometimes humans don't like to admit that they didn't entirely learn to walk or learn to talk, there's a lot of stuff that is pre-baked into the development of the brain structure.  It's not that they don't need to be taught a language, but they're primed for it.  You don't need to teach them how to breath, how to vocalize, or even what parts of speech are (until well after they've already been talking).  Even in this case, the few examples thing is greatly exaggerated.  I've read hundreds of books to my niece and nephew and people talk to babies constantly.  Even rather bad parents that don't pay much attention to their children's needs often have on the TV, which is again filled with thousand and thousands of examples of people talking.  

So where do people learn from few examples?  Well, in just the sort of place where Flamingo does, that is, where it is a small extension to a huge number of things they already know.  

So is creativity fundamentally unattainable for AI?  I think it is for current models, but some ways of training are getting closer.  I think there needs to be some level of introspection and self evaluation to get there.  Humans constantly generate and evaluate results internally.  We can synthesize a birdplane and figure out if our imagined birdplane is a bird, a plane, or if we need a new category or if it belongs to all three categories.  We also sleep and dream, two things that are still poorly understood.  During dreaming we seem to pose all sorts of crazy combinations while often suspending parts of the evaluation (whether it is feasible/makes sense/etc...). 

You said one other thing I think is wrong, that it learns rules.  A few model types I might characterize as learning rules, and these large language models do not.  Random Forests and Boosted Trees, stuff like Xbgoost, those learn rules.  Stuff like ChatGPT doesn't, even for style.  It only outputs like that because that is what is nearby in the embedded space after doing the style transform that was learned during training (basically the difference between points in that set in the embedded space vs. random points), but there is no rule going on.  The nearby area may or may not match any proposed 'rule.'  It is perhaps not as obvious when it comes to style, but it is very obvious when it comes to 'facts' the models asserts.  Whether right or wrong, if there were a rule then it would be applied consistently, but we frequently find the model making assertions that directly contradict each other.  I don't know if the model has made exactly this error, but an example of the type of mistake I mean is that it could assert that dogs are animals, that dalmatians and golden retrievers are dogs, but that dalmatians aren't animals.  The issue I'm pointing out isn't that it got a fact wrong, but that there isn't really any rule under there.  Sure, humans sometimes do this as well, but we do have mechanisms where these things are brought to our attention and we try to iron out the inconsistencies (not necessarily successfully), that is, we try to have a rule, even if it sometimes gets a fair number of caveats, e.g. i before e, except after c... and several other conditions.  Rule based models, like those mentioned earlier, don't really have a latent or embedded space though, and many of the rules are hard thresholds, so it isn't so easy to blend them get something that appears to be 'creative.'   If you learned rules for bird and rules for plane, then the birdplane doesn't go in both and doesn't get a new category, it gets pocketed wherever the rules put it (though yes, you can do this statistically  based on the number of rules conformed to or broken and weight the rules with some importance).",1

The core problem here is the idea that people will put their faith in it.  There's absolutely no reason to put faith in it, and both common sense and the explicit disclaimers of the creators are telling people not to do so.

The phenomenon you're referring to isn't unique to code, either.  While there are some triggers in place for certain simple questions that cause it to give canned errors, any time to you ask it a creative enough question about something it doesn't understand, it's likely to make up nonsense.

2. You read it and say ""oh, that's obviously wrong"".  You ignore it and look for another answer.
3. You read it and say ""that looks right, but I don't know the API well enough to know if it will compile.""  They you can try it, copy and paste if you like.  If it compiles, it's probably right.  You have verified the logic, and the only question is whether the method names or whatever are right.  Your compiler or even rudimentary unit tests will catch those errors, so you need not worry about them.

Here is an example( not coding )

From ChatGPT

me: is it likely that google also has an ai as advanced as you are?

CGPT: It is likely that Google has an AI as advanced as I am, or even more advanced. Google is a leader in the field of artificial intelligence and has invested heavily in research and development in this area.

Google has developed a number of AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies have been applied to a wide range of applications, including search, advertising, and image and video analysis.

In addition, Google has developed its own AI platform, called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers to build and train machine learning models. TensorFlow is capable of handling large amounts of data and can be used to train advanced AI models.

Overall, it is likely that Google has AI technologies and platforms that are as advanced, or even more advanced, than I am. Google is a leader in the field of AI and has made significant investments in research and development in this area.

edit:

me: why wouldn't google release it for everyone like openai?

CGPT:

It is unlikely that Google would release its advanced AI technologies for everyone like OpenAI. OpenAI is a non-profit organization that is focused on advancing the field of AI for the benefit of all humanity. As a result, OpenAI often releases its AI technologies and research publicly for anyone to use and build upon.

In contrast, Google is a for-profit company that is focused on creating technologies and products that generate revenue and profits for the company. As a result, Google is more likely to keep its advanced AI technologies proprietary and use them to develop products and services that can be sold to customers.

Additionally, Google may have concerns about releasing its advanced AI technologies publicly, as this could lead to competition from other companies that could use the technologies to develop similar products and services. This could potentially harm Google's business and reduce its market share.

Overall, while Google may have advanced AI technologies that are similar to those developed by OpenAI, it is unlikely that Google would release them publicly like OpenAI. Google is focused on creating products and services that generate revenue and profits, and may have concerns about competition and potential harm to its business.

My point was, there are _plenty_ of us out there who works on things far more complicated where <5% of our problems can be solved by searching for SO answers. That’s the difference between developers and engineers I guess, if there is even a distinction these days.

2. I know it’s a correct data type, safeguards have been put in place to ensure that already
3. “Encountering a memory error” well no shit chapGPT!!! Imagine that, providing an inaccurate raster stride value causes geo_rasterize to run way more computations than necessary, resulting in a memory error. 

The rest is all garbage. My point is, this is one example where chatGPT is light years away from truly being able to help with the issue, and is only able to regurgitate the very basic rules that anyone working on this stuff daily learned week 1.

Think about it - students or people maintaining simple CRUD apps (no hate at all, we all started somewhere!) are _much_ more likely to spend time playing around with and talking about a tool that can do the same things they do daily; people who have to spend their time solving very complex problems 1. don’t have a ton of time to spend hours playing around with this 2. don’t care to spend a ton of time talking about it, as, while it may be cool, it’s not helping or impacting their work on a daily basis.

Experts have more reliable sources of information, that actually have contextual awareness, the ability to remember a discussion and make thoughtful points, etc. - each other.

Again: AI is designed to be a shortcut that mimics the data it's been fed. It can have utility. But it isn't optimized for truth, logic, or consistency, and those are the principal qualities a space like SO should strive for.

how do you know if someone is arguing against ChatGPT, spreading hatred against it, is not written by bot?

702,,0,dahennakin,57,228,None,0,If you feed the training data more and more with generated data without knowing you get more bad results the more you mix without actually knowing. The machine is learning its faulty generated data as groundtruth. This could be a big problem with the approach to actually use platforms like these for data input - which I sumhow like because the actual training mechanism is just nice to see partially working - but there is no deeper understanding of things working like scientifical laws which need to be understood. It's like a machine which is learning math by heart because it is not able to base its knowledge on learned logic / math. I am curious how they will try to model this within the neuro-networks in later versions.,1
