Question,"I have signed up for an account at OpenAI and asked ChatGPT a programming question, namely:
How to list all files in an Android device recursively with Java
And in an instant, it generated an answer in less than a second and the answer was correct. Given that most users post to Stack Overflow and don't even get an answer to their question, this could be a relief to most users who experience this and would discourage anyone plagiarizing code from OpenAI and pasting it here to gain reputation. But technology is advancing and we are becoming more and more independent of human skill to find solutions to programming challenges. Some high reputation contributors ignore questions deliberately but openchat gpt came to save the day. The speed and the accuracy of OpenAI responses are what gives it an edge over Stack Overflow and then users won't get banned or question limit imposed on users based on time intervals. Your thoughts and views on this matter are welcome, could openchat GPT be the end of Stack Overflow?

Answer,"Perhaps some future AI program will be able to reliably answer SO questions, but ChatGPT certainly cannot do it. And even if you gave it ten times as much training data, it still couldn't do it, no matter how good that training data was.
GPT-3, the large language model underlying ChatGPT, is certainly an impressive piece of language processing software. But that's all it is. ChatGPT is not intended to be an artificial intelligence, although it may give some people the initial impression that it has some intelligence.
ChatGPT generates plausible text, consistent with its training data and input, but it doesn't know what it's talking about, and it has no way of representing or evaluating the truth of its utterances. Yes, it can say true things, but it can also say complete nonsense, and it can't tell the difference.
ChatGPT does not attempt to make truthful or even logical statements. Its job is to create ""completions"" of the text you feed it. It's ultimately doing the same kind of tasks as the spelling-checker and word suggestion feature supplied with modern phone keyboards, except that it's working with deeper and broader linguistic structures.
It has no problems making grammatically correct utterances with no spelling errors, and those utterances are linguistically consistent with the input you feed it and its training data. But it's only operating on linguistic structure, it is oblivious to the underlying logic and truth value of the statements it makes. It may emit text which is logically valid and true, but that's just a fortunate side-effect of the linguistic structure and its training data. In extended passages, it can easily say things that are logically inconsistent. And it has no way to evaluate how relevant its utterances are to the input data, apart from the linguistic consistency. So when it says true and useful things that's just a lucky coincidence.
ChatGPT often makes stupid errors of logic and silly arithmetic errors. OTOH, we have theorem-proving AI that can handle complex logic, and sophisticated mathematical systems that can do arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. In the future, we will surely have natural language software that can handle logic and mathematics, but the current incarnation of ChatGPT won't magically gain those abilities merely by throwing more training data at it.

Stephen Wolfram has written some excellent articles about how ChatGPT works, its limitations, and the potential benefit of combining it with Wolfram | Alpha. Please see What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work? and Wolfram|Alpha as the Way to Bring Computational Knowledge Superpowers to ChatGPT.
Update July 2024: There is now Wolfram GPT, which combines Wolfram Alpha and ChatGPT. Here is its login / signup page.

Stack Overflow tries to solve the inaccuracy in people with votes, comments, and community and having the accurate answers bubble to the top. This is needed more in a world where validation of information is lacking in these systems.
So I predict Stack Overflow is not going anywhere any time soon.

Answer,"For GPT3 or ChatGPT3.5 I would not have agreed, but for ChatGPT4 and for programming tasks (in my case mostly in R and Python) and the field I work in (biostatistics) I agree. Using ChatGPT4, the answers that come out are for me generally more or less on a par with the quality of an average SO answer, and perhaps even similar to the quality of the currently best accepted answers on Stack Overflow. Here some concrete examples. For example, it was able to answer a 5 year old highly rated question that I awarded several bonuses for, producing working OpenGL+SDL code called via the rdyncall package (which is currently not even on CRAN). Or based on a verbal description of a biological problem (that had not been solved in the academic literature before) ChatGPT4 inferred how to correctly write this as a differential equation system and it was also happy to make further modifications to put in extra biological parameters, and then fired up Wolfram Alpha to determine the long-term equilibrium. Here the question plus part of the answer.


The answer to this question (reproduced almost verbatim from ChatGPT4, but with output of the ChatGPT R code included & maths verified to be correct) was also better than any of the other available answers.
On Cross Validated / Stats Stackexchange only 8 out of my 20 questions I asked were ever answered (with an answer that I accepted) - 3 of which by myself. That's only a success rate of 25% to get useful help from others that solved my original problem. If I paste the unanswered questions into ChatGPT4 I would count about 83% as useful & largely or entirely correct (i.e. I would have given them a checkmark, whereas the current answers are either beating about the bush, not solving my original problem or are plain wrong & for some there is no answer at all).
Sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get things right, but so does getting a correct answer on Stack Overflow - that also usually still requires prodding other users posting answers and telling them ""no, I would like this or that instead"" or ""your solution is not working because xxx"" etc. I would say that most of the info on ChatGPT here on SO is (1) factually incorrect, (2) highly outdated & referring to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4 and (3) extremely opinionated. For example, this article citing the poor maths capabilities of ChatGPT applies to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4, which can now use the Wolfram Alpha plugin and according to recent benchmarks in fact excels at math. And with the use of the ScholarAI & browser plugin it can also give sources. Sure, anything that comes out needs checking. But most current Stack Overflow answers could also use a thorough check & a lot of edits.
So I would see good scope for AI and humans to work together to tilt our capabilities to a new level & get good answers for more questions here on SO. But of course with appropriate guardrails in place to prevent abuse. And mainly in the context of programming related questions, where I would then require reproducible code and output or benchmarks plus citation of a credible source & disclosure of the use of ChatGPT or Github Copilot if it was used, to make sure that any answers are actually correct. I would also not accept plain copy & paste answers. Nowadays most of us will probably be at least inspired by GPT when answering any question really. For those that Google using BING GPT4 is now the default search engine...

Answer,"ChatGPT largely is Stack Overflow, albeit trimmed and polished to match the user's request.  So the ironic thing is, if everyone started using ChatGPT instead of SO, a significant source of ChatGPT's source of knowledge would dry up.
What to do?  Stack Overflow should include provision for people to post their questions and answers from ChatGPT. These could be commented upon, and voted up or down as with any post or its replies
Doing this would: 1) benefit the community (instead of remaining private), 2) provide corroboration, correction, and refinement for the poster, and 3) give ChatGPT more knowledge to digest.

Answer,"Some dudes are shooting the messenger because they don't like the message.
Here is an answer from ChatGPT itself:

While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering a wide range of
questions, Stack Overflow still serves a valuable purpose as a
community-driven platform for technical Q&A. Rather than replacing
Stack Overflow, ChatGPT could be used in conjunction with the site to
provide additional support and guidance for users.
One possibility would be to integrate ChatGPT's capabilities into
Stack Overflow's existing interface, allowing users to ask questions
in a conversational format and receive instant responses. This could
potentially help users who are struggling to formulate their questions
or who are looking for guidance on how to approach a particular
problem.
However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks of such an
approach, such as the risk of information overload or the possibility
of inaccurate or incomplete responses. Ultimately, any changes to
Stack Overflow should be carefully evaluated to ensure that they align
with the site's goals of providing accurate, high-quality technical
information to users

Answer,"
Your thoughts and views on this matter are welcome...

Speed yes, accuracy no. One example is not enough to draw any conclusion. Please conduct a more thorough investigation.
The speed of the response generation of the service you used is indeed impressive, although I wouldn't say it's necessarily much faster than using a search engine like Google and clicking on the presented link to Stack Overflow, for example.
Accuracy is unfortunately not yet that good. In same cases it gave acceptable results, but in others not, when I tested it. I cannot recommend it yet.
Why is your and my experience so vastly different? Maybe because you drew a conclusion from only a very small amount of examples (N=1?). That cannot work. There hasn't been done enough example generation and evaluation for the claim to be supported by the evidence.
It's futile to discuss the implications of something we do not know with sufficient certainty yet. We need to study this service more. I'm quite sure that scientists do that already.
Just as a side comment. ChatGPT is competition (capable or incapable) for this platform, but for a knowledge seeker it's just another (useful or not useful) source of information. How useful? The jury is still out.

Comment on Answer,did you ask it a programming question? it works,user16612111,0,2,0
Answer,"I've been using ChatGPT to answer programming questions for weeks. Unless I've been manipulating it poorly, quite simply, ChatGPT takes a great deal of prodding and pleading to get a complete, correct response from, when a correct response is achievable at all. It's a tool, basically a jacked-up autocomplete that's wrong, say, more than half the time.
For example, here's some code it wrote for an extremely trivial programming task, finding the minimum element in an enumerable in Elixir:
def find_smallest(numbers) do
  Enum.min(numbers)
end

Fine and well. I asked it to translate this code to Dart and it provided this wrong answer[1]:

To solve the problem of finding the smallest number in a list in Dart, you can use the min function from the dart:math library.
Here is an example of how you could implement the find_smallest function in Dart:
import 'dart:math';

int findSmallest(List<int> numbers) {
  return numbers.min();
}

You can then use the expect function from the package:test library to write test cases for the function.
[bunch of test cases that the function fails on]

This is the sort of plausible-looking ChatGPT-based answer you'd see flooding Stack Overflow before the ban.
I'm not a Dart programmer, so after this failed, I looked it up on SO to find the human solution. This isn't an isolated incident. It's the typical workflow using ChatGPT at the present time.
There's no doubt that it's an amazing piece of technology that's correct some of the time. It's helped me quickly solve certain problems over the past few weeks. I don't doubt that it solved the problem you mentioned for you. When successful, it's magic. The problem is, it reveals itself as unreliable once you put it through the ringer on a variety of problems. I'm not talking about 80% accuracy, from what I've seen, more like 40% accuracy.

But technology is advancing and we are becoming more and more independent of human skill to find solutions to programming challenges

Not really. Human skill is just as important as ever. Nowadays, one needs to be extremely judicious about separating fact from fiction and separating plausible-looking solutions from truly correct ones.
Unless large strides are made soon, ChatGPT is nowhere near replacing Stack Overflow or programmers in general any more than self-driving mode will be replacing human drivers.

[1]: I'm aware that asking the same question again, differently or at a later time may give the correct answer for this problem. That doesn't change the fact that it fails catastrophically like this often, on simple tasks.

GPTs don't offer much of these opportunities for me. The points are fun but not really important. I'd happily move to Codidact if there were more questions there I could answer--I don't have any points there.",ggorlen,56033,1,0

Comment on Answer,"@Yohst If GPTs are better than SO at fixing most dumb mistakes and helping people access the resources they should be looking at before posting on SO, this seems like a fine scenario, although I still don't quite understand why not consult the docs and existing resources directly. It's also interesting how many people still wind up taking the time to show up on old meta threads to talk about how they've quit SO, GPTs are so much better, SO community is so awful, so glad they never need to talk to humans again, programming is solved, etc. But wait, why are they still here?",ggorlen,56033,2,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst Again, I don't agree that SO has the attitude blind spots you suggest. The users who feel SO is so toxic probably misunderstand what we're trying to do here. The best benefit GPTs offer is redirecting people who don't look at docs or make an effort to craft high-quality, original content away from SO. GPTs are basically probabalistic doc/SO answer/GitHub code regurgitators. They're being misused as a lazier, more error-prone and environmentally damaging way to find the information that's already out there, with a dollop of saccharine over-politeness on top to make you feel good.",ggorlen,56033,2,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst I agree that SO does have a problem with some answerers who are more interested in reputation than curation. They should be closing duplicate questions rather than re-answering them to gain rep. However, I'm guessing you'll find these closures to be problematic if you're asking the question (most users do, failing to communicate with the SME that closed the question). FWIW, I started using SO shortly after beginning programming and have never had to actually ask a question, because I can always find an answer on the site, all prior to GPTs. Many users don't search before asking.",ggorlen,56033,3,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst  Rarely do I see personal insults or genuine toxicity. Those are against the rules and should be flagged. Most of the time when I see such comments, they're coming from users posting low-quality content, not curators, moderators or subject matter experts. Most ""SO has an attitude problem"" complainers don't like or understand the site rules and want to treat it like a help desk rather than a Wikipedia-like knowledge resource. GPTs work well for them because they're trained to act like the on-demand help desk servant they expect SO to be.",ggorlen,56033,3,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst We disagree that there's an attitude problem on SO. There's a meme that SO has ""toxic"" moderation culture, but my experience that these accusations come from users who misunderstand the culture, barge in with unanswerable, poorly-asked questions and are then shocked by closures, downvotes and comments asking for clarification from volunteers who spend their time trying to build a high-quality resource.",ggorlen,56033,4,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst By all means, go ahead and use GPTs if you think they're more valuable than SO. If you find its pandering attitude more appropriate than genuine human interaction, you're entitled to that. I'd personally rather have someone push back against my incorrect assumptions than have a ""yes"" machine continually tell me how great I am and apologize continually as it keeps feeding me hallucinated lies and failing code. That said, GPTs do have uses, so I'm not interested in creating a false dichotomy. I'm trying to prevent GPT output from overrunning the human resource it's trained on, that's all.",ggorlen,56033,2,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst You got me. Sorry for misreading. If you're basically agreeing, is the point of your response just to take a dig at the SO community's ""attitude""? I didn't realize misreading constituted an attitude problem.",ggorlen,56033,3,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst Case in point: check this thread where OP is begging answerers to stop posting GPT output. ""Please.. no more ChatGPT. If I want to use ChatGPT I can use it myself :(""",ggorlen,56033,3,0
Comment on Answer,"@Yohst Nobody is stopping you from using GPTs, and you're entirely able to use them instead of SO if you don't like human answers (of course, ironically, GPTs do nothing more than basically cough up those same human answers probabalistically). How does dumping random GPT output on SO help you use GPTs easier or add any value to anything? It certainly degrades the value of SO, and has been shown to degrade the value of LLMs by polluting their training data. It's a lose/lose. The win/win is: use SO for human answers, use GPTs for whatever benefits you accrue from them, separately from SO.",ggorlen,56033,2,0
Comment on Answer,"In this comment I linked to a ChatGPT answer posted by a 12k+ member (before the ban). The answer text seems to make sense, and the code looks good, but they're rubbish. The loop should use continue to skip duplicates, but instead it uses break, so the loop ends when it finds the first dupe, and hence the output array is truncated. But statistically, break is much more common than continue...",PM 2Ring,55297,8,0
Answer,"Well, when I entered How to list all files in an Android device recursively with Java into Google, I got links to several Stack Overflow Q&A, also in less than a second. The first one has 7 different answers, and the second one has 33 different answers. People have already voted on whether the proposed solutions were helpful to them or not; the top answer on one of them has 442 upvotes and 1 downvote, so I already know that hundreds of humans have reviewed the answer for correctness.
You got one ChatGPT answer that no one else had reviewed but that just happened to be correct (and that's not always the case); in the same amount of time, I got 40 answers to choose from (all of them reviewed by other humans before, in many cases hundreds of times).
Imagine what would've happened if ChatGPT's answer hadn't been correct; what would you do then - ask it the same question and hope for a different answer? Or just post a Stack Overflow question instead?
You can downvote a bad Stack Overflow answer or comment asking for clarification, but there's no recourse for a bad ChatGPT answer.
Also,

Some high reputation contributors ignore questions deliberately...

Given that most high-rep users got that way in the first place mostly by answering questions, this claim is close to self-defeating. Personally, I have 609 answers (vs. 61 questions), so I guess I didn't ignore at least 609 questions. Jon Skeet didn't ignore 35,534 questions. Gordon Linoff didn't ignore 85,121 questions. VonC didn't ignore 29,184 questions. I could keep going with this, but the point is the vast majority of people become high-rep by answering lots of questions.
By way of contrast, you have asked 61 questions (50 of which have at least one answer and 34 have an accepted answer) and have only written 9 answers, so there is a certain irony in you accusing us of deliberately ignoring questions.

Comment on Answer,"@brat Depends on the nature of typo. The vast majority of the time a comment like, ""You defined FooBar and implemented foobar"" or ""you mixed up i and j in the for loop[,]"" is enough to get the asker back on the right path and isn't going to help anyone else. Writing a formal answer and keeping the question visible is just adding noise to the search results. Close it and let the roomba do its job.

Answer,"ChatGPT is not the end of Stack Overflow. SO isn't designed to give answers to everyone who asks. The goal is to offer quality answers so that people don't have to ask a question. We trust that people who answer are experts who check their answers. The answers have value because they explain some programming concept in an easy and correct way. Speed is irrelevant as the correct answer can be posted at any time even years later.
ChatGPT is able to produce an answer that isn't necessarily correct or best practice. It might work for you but it's not coming from a programming expert.
In the long run ChatGPT may help Stack Overflow if it can provide correct answers to simple questions. This could help avoid duplicates of common questions from being asked.

Comment on Answer,Yesterday I asked ChatGPT how I could pass in a list of parameters in a JSON string to a SQL server proc and use those for the IN part of a WHERE clause.
