2,1,1,pollylang,159,561,None,0,"Yeah. Every time these companies ask for my phone number, it makes me cringe. But unfortunately it is somewhat of a common practice these days. If it's any consolation, you are not missing very much. üòÅ (This is a sub for ""humors"" ü§™)",10

Others didn't notice and seriously talked with them). Yes I know that your post was meant for humor, nothing against your post.",2
4,3,3,pollylang,159,561,None,0,"I am not sure if you can really spot it here. It's THAT good. But, not because it's genuine but because it's a fantastic plagiarizer. That's the way *i* see it. It produces sentences and paragraphs which it ""learned"" from the web. Essentially. So you cannot tell. Nobody can. Just copy and paste, to a large extent. Again, in my view. Many people may disagree tho.",1
5,4,4,Feztopia,3073,28590,None,0,"I see it as a funhouse mirror. It mirrors what it sees in the internet... stuff that's written by humans. But it also distorts it. And yes people already managed to evade some of the restrictions openai put on them, some ways which I also did think of. It looks smart but still is so dumb that it can be tricked.",2

Ok than tell me my number.

""Ever get a spam call before?""
No, but I'm not surprised if you got such calls.",1

Never got a spam call? You should try being a little more subtle when lying.",-1

Just because I do not have information, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not for sale or better yet doesn‚Äôt mean it hasn‚Äôt been sold countless times.
