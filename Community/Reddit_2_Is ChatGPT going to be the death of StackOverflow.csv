Ask a travel question on /r/Travel and unless you are coming up with something incredibly novel or the mob-mind gods are on your side at that moment you're going to be downvoted.

Also to be fair to the sub 9 times out of 10 it genuinely is a question that you could find on Google quickly.

However, you start going into niche subs you can get friendly helpful people because they are just happy you're there. 

I'm sure if you go onto the /r/PHP5_6_2 subreddit and ask a question that's actually related to PHP 7 they are going to be like ""oh actually this sub is dedicated to PHP5.6.2 but here is how you can fix your mysqli\_ function, also you should consider using PDO"".

I know there is internet search capability but we're talking about what it was trained on and could predict successfully. So the question in my mind isn't so much - is GPT out of date, but rather - is accuracy in the predicted response diminished by how recent the themes are, or the way we've asked the question?

In some respects, the specific content we're seeking (asking about news and or scientific breakthroughs), could be out of date. But the way we ask questions and a lot of the information we seek hasn't really changed. There are an awful lot of things you can ask which will remain the same and likely work under previously trained data (general logic, crafting different types of replies, suggesting recipes, formatting, coding, analysis, etc).

Don't ask GPT to do something like count the syllables in words, or name who the current secretary or energy is (it might get it right but that's not the point). There are quicker and easier ways to get that sort of factual information and you're wasting your time if that's how you're using it.

And when you hit enter it will just write the function for you. 

And your example above is quite tame, when you get used to working with it and you know how to prompt it, it can write multiple classes with multiple methods to solve quite complex problems. 

I recently asked it to help me with a game I am making where I wanted it to build routes between solar systems with certain restrictions and it said “sure you should be so and so’s minimum spanning tree algorithm for that” and it generated multiple functions that worked on the first try and integrated seamlessly with the existing classes I hade been talking to it about.

Then in another question, you will copy a snippet of your code, and they will close the question because the snippet is missing a bracket, which you explained was farther down in the code. Did they read that? No. Do they care? No. 

When you defend your question, they will act like they have done you the most biggestest favor ever and how dare you explain you didn't do something incredibly basic wrong, so everybody has wasted their time. 

The times I have been genuinely helped by stackoverflow are next to zero; if your problem goes beyond ""help how do I add a new pandas column in groupby"", if it uses anything but the most common packages, I will get nothing.
