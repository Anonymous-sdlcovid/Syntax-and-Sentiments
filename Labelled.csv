If human answering takes a deep dive, it would have a lot less training data to work with. So it's in both OpenAI and SO's best interest to find a way to integrate I think. 

Biggest issue is token limit, long term memory and 0 shot learning. 

The caveat would be if we can find a model with some sort of liquid learning, with a nearly unlimited token limit, that could also basically update/finetune it's training and use larger reasoning. 

Then it could ingest a whole library, and do things like write docs, answer questions, fix bugs. But right now those limits are pretty hard, and that's something we haven't really seen much development in. 

I think it would require models other than generative pretrained transformers, models we don't currently have. Token limits and lack of a real longterm/shorterm memory that isn't just a hack or workaround stop it from really replacing it now. 

I think the next big breakthrough may come with either an entirely new model that's more multimodal, or parallel models trained on entirely different data that work with a language model to give it more capability. Like a brain.

A model specifically made for encoding short and longterm memory and recall, a model specifically made for inferring code functionality, a model specifically made for abstract reasoning, a model specifically made for coordination.

Right now there's a couple very BIG hard limits to things like ChatGPT (as impressive as it is) that are probably a long ways off yet. (4+ years to see first iterations). 

As of now we can only jankily hack around them, but that's not really a solution as you can only paint over the shortcomings, not remove them.

Regardless of how good the workarounds are, you can't teach it do ingest a couple millions lines of code and tell you why you're getting an error. The best we will do in that regard is as you describe, which IMO is okay but not anything that's gonna replace the real reason people go to SO. 

Maybe I'm wrong, would be curious about your project when you have something. But having gone down the rabbit hole since early access beta in 2019 or whenever, I think that these are still very limiting issues that currently can't be hacked around. Having played around with this since gpt2 days, I think I have a good understanding of the real hard limits and imo this is one. Regardless of how much you compress memories, fitting the context needed into 10k tokens just really isn't feasible and the actual abstract reasoning isn't there and probably won't be until we find a way to actually train a model to do that.

And by itself ChatGPT is cool, but the problem with all of these AI tools is that when you just want a code snippet fast it doesn't gove you any great value as ChatGPT itself is unreliable (as it is often not accessible) and does take it's time to answer your question.
And then you still need to check all of these answers as they are good, but sometimes can be wrong which means that in the case of having always the right answer for the question is also not completely the case.

It can answer questions so accurately that it's legitimately scary

It will be just as scary when it's wrong, but many won't realize until the consequences™ come.

Would a bot such as this one change the future of question and answer sites?

With the benefit of hindsight, to a degree, yes, of course, and to some degree, they'll continue to do so.

For context, this post's original revisions took a much more defensive stance, viewing the question from an angle of ""how useful would it be for AI-generated answers be posted on Stack Exchange?"" My previous answer focused heavily on need for quality in questions, and my defense for the continuing value of the Stack Exchange network was based on ""garbage in, garbage out""- both for questions and source/training data:

If someone doesn't know how to ask a good question, they're going to have a harder time getting a good answer from an LLM tool.

For any new field with less information about it included in LLM training data and less SEO juice to get good info found in web search results, likelihood of a LLM + search engine giving useful results is probably going to be low.


A year has passed, and the aspect of this question that I find interesting has changed. Concerning the future of Stack Exchange, my new interest is in the net benefits this technology has provided / is providing- not on the whole world, but here.


could this be a way to accurately answer questions that are on any of the Stack Exchange sites?

Sure? (to an extent.) Nowadays, there are hybrids of search engines and LLMs, so all it needs to do is do a web search, and basically churn and regurgitate any existing answer content.
I've heard tons of people online and my friends say that they find technologies like ChatGPT to be a useful tool for getting answers to questions. Many of them who have newbie experience on Stack Exchange comment that they prefer it over Stack Exchange so they don't have to deal with grumpy experts.
That's what ChatGPT is good at: service with a smile, all the time.
People like that. Traffic has certainly declined (see Did Stack Exchange's traffic go down since ChatGPT?).
Okay, so how the heck do I see benefit in that?
Dealing with problematic question content is costly. It costs time, and it costs patience. It costs that to deal with questions that are missing key details, questions that are (for lack of better description) just a mess, questions that are duplicates, questions where potential for long-term value is covered in three feet of unnecessary context (and usually the hidden gem has already been asked before), etc. And each of those categories abound endlessly. Deal with it enough and it sucks the joy out of building a long-term knowledgebase.
ChatGPT and similar technologies do two things for that:

It ""tricks"" people into doing research and basic troubleshooting.
I say ""trick"", but really I mean that it masks research-related activities into a form that people find palatable. For some reason, many people either don't like to, or don't know how to google things (not that googling is a pre-requisite for asking a question on Stack Exchange (see How should we deal with Google questions? and Embrace the non-Googlers), but in my experience, it's usually (for question askers) a better search engine than the one built into Stack Exchange sites). But when the search engine is hidden behind a conversation with a machine, suddenly people find it very attractive (I guess the degree of synthesis and summarization (accurate/faithful or not) is also a factor).
This isn't always a productive thing. We all know that an LLM can spit out falsehood as well as it can spit out truth. It can mislead people, and that can result in those people posting weird questions on Stack Exchange (Ex. I'm trying to do X and ChatGPT told me to do Y (which makes no sense)).
But a lot of duplicates are very poor in quality, and less of those is a good thing. It means less curation workload, and less clutter mucking up searchability (bad signposts weigh out good ones). I've also started to see a (very small but hopefully increasing) trend in questions that show actually useful information prompted by conversation with an LLM. While this is slightly disappointing to me, since a lot of basic troubleshooting can be written statically and has no need for neural network involvement, it would seem that many of the people who love this technology are not the type to seek out the loving manual.

It (to some degree) deals with the boring, obscure, one-off requirement dumps / questions that just require a lot of synthesis of basic concepts / questions with a bunch of unnecessary context.
Or at least- that's what it seems to me like people who are trying to develop developer tooling around these technologies are trying to apply it to do.
People are often too lazy to do or just don't know how to do is generalize their questions (de-localize / create things like Minimal Reproducible Examples) while not blowing up the question scope (staying focused), or to break them down into separate questions that are appropriately scoped for Stack Exchange. I don't get an awful lot of those questions in the tags I answer in, so I don't know how much this situation has changed, but I hope that among the classes of questions that are no longer being posted, there are fewer of these.


And in doing those boring things, it doesn't get grumpy. It has no social battery (well, it consumes a heck ton of energy to run, but that's a different can of worms).
I don't particularly care if ChatGPT wastes someone's time with a bunch of unhelpful info.
To the contrary, I welcome any side-effect that this technology has had on reduction in lower-quality question posts / increase in overall quality of question posts on Stack Exchange.
There are potential hidden costs- fewer people using the sites directly means fewer votes (and voting matters), and potentially missing some gems of questions and losing out on them to the machine. But a lot of people can't vote anyway, and I think if a question is useful enough, as long as this platform itself can retain its reputation as a trusted resource, the gems will find their way here.

SO_Thread_Could ChatGPT be a viable way to answer people39s questions.csv,,,-12,171,0,"I would think there is definitely scope for AI to assist humans in providing good answers. Especially the latest version ChatGPT4 (with plugins like Wolfram Alpha for maths or ScholarAI or the web browser plugins to give sources) has very good performance quantified based on various benchmarks, e.g. ability to solve university entrance exams correctly (often top10% relative to avg. human) or maths ability. See my answer here giving some examples of how with the help of ChatGPT4 I was able to answer various SO questions, including ones that had never received an answer, despite being highly ranked and having been awarded 4 bounties before. Of course adequate advice on responsible AI use would need to be given, cf. the guidelines of many academic journals like PNAS on the use of generative AI. Especially for programming related questions I think allowing responsible AI usage could be beneficial. The guideline should then include that if ChatGPT or Github Copilot was used to develop code that reproducible code & a benchmark plus output should be given (confirming that the user verified the code works correctly, ChatGPT can't yet run code yet) & that use of ChatGPT should be disclosed & a reputable source should be given. That is very easy to check - much easier than telling if a given answer might have used ChatGPT if not disclosed. I would also not allow for plain copy & paste answers. So critical that appropriate guardrails to counter abuse would be in place. But I definitely see scope for humans & AI to work together to answer some of the questions on SO, especially when it concerns programming related questions (where reproducible code would make them easy to verify) and questions that never received an adequate reply. I would also suggest to add a checkbox ""GPT assisted answer"" so that user that would not like to see this content could still disable this if they would like. But why not make use of the free knowledge of user paying for ChatGPT4 & those that use it to assist in helping to answer questions on SO? If I look at the questions I ever asked on Cross Validated / Stats Stackexchange there is only 8 out of 20 questions that ever received an adequate answer, 3 of which I provided myself. If I paste the remaining unanswered questions in ChatGPT4 I would have checked 83% of the answers as being mostly or entirely correct (i.e. I would have marked them as correct accepted answers). With a bit of extra work these answers could surely be improved a bit further & it would be valuable to have them as correct, vetted answers.
Also, let's not forget: all those that having Bing as their search engine now by default get a GPT4 produced answer to their web search queries. So I would think that perhaps for most answers GPT now at least provided some inspiration for any answer... The important part is just teaching users how to use this technology responsibly & provide clear guidance on how to use it, as well as to point out its limitations. Imho, instead of fighting AI, humans and AI should work together to lift their abilities to a new level and allow them to solve problems they couldn't solve before. In the same way that we don't expect mathematicians or physicists to solve everything with pencil and paper and stop using computers.

Even assuming that Google's CEO has an accurate picture of who and how writes their gargantuan code base, what they do is not our concern.

Using AI to assist with software development is not the same as presenting solutions to other people's questions as if you were a subject-matter expert.


The main issues with AI posts (answers in particular) which prompted the ban all remain:

No matter how good a GenAI model is, they can still hallucinate. There's even research that suggests AI models may never not hallucinate. The burden of vetting such content that looks good on the surface but may be fundamentally flawed then falls on the shoulders of an already strained community.
GenAI content can be produced at a much faster rate than what the community is able to curate/moderate
Even for vetted content, moderators (but anyone except the poster really) are unable to verify claims that the content was actually vetted beforehand. It'd come down to hunches and subjective bias. That kind of moderation is prone to be unfair and ineffective.
plagiarism: after having handled thousands of AI flags on this site, I can tell you that almost nobody gives proper credit to the AI. Folks tend to present the content as their own, thus misrepresenting someone else's work.
The only value proposition that Stack Overflow still has over an LLM is that there's the expectation that a human being has authored the text as written.
Allowing for an exception this big to the AI ban would open the floodgates.

There is a case to be made about using AI to improve a post's grammar, formatting, etc. but that suffers from the same issues as point #3.
I really don't see how we could realistically allow AI content in almost any form while staying true to Stack Overflow's values and a Community made of humans at its core.

People starting out are not really encouraged to ask, ""stupid questions"". The problem is you don't know what you don't know. So if asking questions to learn is discouraged, why would you continue to seek knowledge by asking people? The only stupid question is the one left unasked IMO.

You will get people arguing over the wording of your answers. People will then come and change the wording, which changes the meaning. Because they think they know what you meant. I've not personally had this issue, but I've seen it enough to know it's a bad problem.

It brings probably the most arrogant engineers I've ever met. People you simply cannot have a conversation with.
